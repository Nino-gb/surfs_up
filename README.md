# Surf_up Analysis



## Overview

Run some analytics weather dataset to demonstrate that Hawaii, Ohau Island have the perfect weather to open a surf -ice cream shop business.

## Purpose

Use Sqlite , SQLAlchemy, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Flask to analyze the 12 months of weather stations, temperature and precipitation levels to show the cold, hard, data that proves Oahu as the perfect place for the new surf shop. Investor will be able to find solid statistical analysisâ€”such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and visualization plots. 

The temperature data trend for the months of June and December determinate if the surf shop business can be sustainable year-round

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

###  Summary Statistics for June

- Import the sqlalchemy extract function.

- Write a query that filters the Measurement table to retrieve the temperatures for the month of June

- Create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of June

- Calculate and print out the summary statistics for the June temperature DataFrame with describe function

### Summary Statistics for December

- Write a query that filters the Measurement table to retrieve the temperatures for the month of December

- Convert the December temperatures to a list.

- Create a DataFrame from the list of temperatures for the month of December

- Calculate and print out the summary statistics for the December temperature DataFrame







## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
